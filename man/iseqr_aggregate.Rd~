\title{
Aggregate Adaptive Immunoseq data by amino acid
}
\description{
Data provided by Adaptive includes TCR counts at the nucleotide level. This function combines synonymous nucleotide sequences while keeping the nucleotide level data intact (optional). Any meta-data added to the data set after iseqr_merge will be lost (i.e. only 'aa' and 'nt' are kept).
}
\usage{
iseqr_aggregate(ds,inc_nt=TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ds}{A data set generated from iseqr_merge.}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
\item{ds_out}{output data set. }
\item{ds_out$syn}{The synonymityof the amino-acid level data. }
\item{ds_out$nt}{The comma separated nucleotide(s) that made the amino acid.}
