plot_ranks:
	Make iterative 
	Make paneled graphs
	Restrict to TCRs in tumor
	Most changed sequences
	
Misc:
	Work on tumor analysis
		What happens in the periphery to the most abundant tumor TCRs?
	Work on optimization of # of clones for max overlap difference
	Figure out better way to wrangle metadata in R
